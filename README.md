# Smart-POS-Face-Recognition
This project is a Modern Point-of-Sale (POS) style Attendance System designed for retail environments like Kalyani Collections. Unlike traditional attendance systems, it uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning (KNN) to identify employees/users in real-time, providing a seamless and touchless experience.
